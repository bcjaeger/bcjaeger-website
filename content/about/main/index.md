  I got my doctorate in Biostatistics from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2017. My dissertation developed R-squared statistics for the linear and generalized linear mixed model (see [`r2glmm`](https://github.com/bcjaeger/r2glmm)). In 2016, I was an adjunct professor of statistics at North Carolina Central University, teaching undergraduate and graduate level courses in statistics. From 2017-2021, I was an assistant professor of Biostatistics at University of Alabama at Birmingham. There, I studied machine learning, blood pressure, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and wearable device data. What I like most about research is the programming that supports it. I am an enthusiastic R user, I've made a few R packages, and I've taught introductory courses to programming.
