Over the past year, I've been analyzing follow-up data from participants in the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT), which compared the benefit of treatment of systolic blood pressure to a target of less than 120 mm Hg with treatment to a target of less than 140 mm Hg. I will finish this post once the data are published and I have clarity over copyrights and all that.
