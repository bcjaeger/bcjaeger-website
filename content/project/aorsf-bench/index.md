excerpt: A general benchmark of the `aorsf` package, comparing its computational efficiency, prediction accuracy, and interpretability to leading software packages such as `ranger`, `randomForestSRC`, and `party`. We also show that `aorsf` can run over 500 times faster than its predecessor, `obliqueRSF`.

### aorsf is an R package for oblique random survival forests, designed with a fast core algorithm and a friendly API. aorsf-bench summarizes aorsf's efficiency and prediction accuracy compared to obliqueRSF and several standard packages for risk prediction using machine learning.

I plan on filling this page with the contents of the readme file for `aorsf-bench`, and I plan to work on that readme file very soon. I will also be putting `aorsf-bench` on ArXiv soon. If you are eager to see the results, you can find everything here: https://github.com/bcjaeger/aorsf-bench/blob/main/paper/arxiv/main.pdf
