excerpt: Statisticians are trained to develop novel statistical techniques that can be used to engage with complex problems. However, we are less likely to receive training in software development. Without efficiently coded algorithms, intuitive documentation, and friendly APIs, the methods we 'share' in our R packages may cause frustration and turn potential users away (possibly to a less valid method!). In this talk, I focus on efficiently writing the core algorithms in R packages using Rcpp. I share my experience developing R packages with statistical methods and present four ideas that have made a positive impact on my work.

I'm really excited to give this talk in Washington DC at JSM!
