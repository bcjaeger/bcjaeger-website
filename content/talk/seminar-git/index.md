excerpt: git and GitHub are fantastic tools for version control and collaboration. Data scientists have increasingly used GitHub as a platform for sharing their work and working together thanks to publicly available guides such as Jenny Bryan's _Happy git with R_ textbook. In this seminar, I walk through the basics of git and GitHub, beginning with the jargon of git and proceeding up through submitting pull requests on GitHub.

I think there is a recording of this talk somewhere. I need to reach out and see if I can put a link to it here.
