      <description>aorsf provides optimized software to fit, interpret, and make predictions with oblique random survival forests (ORSFs). Why aorsf? over 400 times faster than obliqueRSF.
accurate predictions for time-to-event outcomes.
negation importance, a novel technique to estimate variable importance for ORSFs.
intuitive API with formula based interface.
extensive input checks + informative error messages.
Installation You can install the development version of aorsf from GitHub with:
# install.packages(&amp;#34;remotes&amp;#34;) remotes::install_github(&amp;#34;bcjaeger/aorsf&amp;#34;) Example The orsf() function is used to fit ORSFs.</description>
